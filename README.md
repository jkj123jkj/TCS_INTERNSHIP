The model uses keras with tensorflow backend. The model is trained to identify the writter from the handwritten style in the images.
Training is done by splitting an image into random patches and matching each patches of image to the corresponding writter. We are using three layer neurons to train the model. The Final prediction accuracy for our model is 80 %

This model uses Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network with keras for identifying the words in the images. The model is built using 150000 synthetic images of english words in it.
